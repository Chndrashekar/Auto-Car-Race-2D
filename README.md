# Auto-Car-Race-2D
The project was inspired by a video game named <strong>"Road Fighter" </strong><br/>
It was designed and developed using OPENGL utility Toolkits(C++) as part of my course project. <br/>
It involves 2D transformations and simple graphics with possible details which is essential for this game. <br/>
