# Auto-Car-Race-2D
<hr>
The project draws inspiration from the classic video game <strong>"Road Fighter" </strong> and was developed using OpenGL Utility Toolkits (C++). <br>
It showcases 2D transformations and effective graphics, capturing the essential elements needed to recreate the game's dynamics. <br>
This project demonstrates my understanding of OpenGL, as well as my ability to implement graphical concepts and transformations in a 2D environment.<br>
